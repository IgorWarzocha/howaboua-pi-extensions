Audit all current dev extensions in .pi/extensions-dev and mark production-ready ones with "x" tag.

## Dev Extensions Inventory

### Extensions to Audit
From .pi/extensions-dev/:
1. **pi-todos** - Todos extension rework
2. **pi-question-tool** - Answer tool for lazy model handling
3. **pi-worktree-forker** - Git worktree automation
4. (Check for others that may exist)

## Audit Process

### Phase 1: Functional Assessment
For each dev extension:
- [ ] Document what it does
- [ ] Assess if core functionality is complete
- [ ] Test if it works at basic level
- [ ] Identify known issues or missing features
- [ ] Note any dependencies on other work

### Phase 2: Production Readiness Check
An extension is marked "x" (ready) when:
- [ ] Core features are working
- [ ] Basic testing has been done
- [ ] No critical bugs blocking use
- [ ] README or documentation is adequate
- [ ] Extension can be safely used in daily workflow

### Phase 3: Tagging and Organization
Mark ready extensions with tags:
- `x` - Production ready, can use daily
- `wip` - Work in progress, actively developing
- `blocked` - Blocked by dependency or external factor
- `experimental` - Experimental, use at own risk
- `deprecated` - Superseded by another extension, consider removal

### Phase 4: Dependency Mapping
For each extension, document:
- [ ] What other extensions it depends on
- [ ] What blocks it from being complete
- [ ] Cross-extension issues or conflicts

## Output Format
Create summary document with:
1. Extension name and purpose
2. Current status (ready/wip/blocked)
3. Known issues
4. Dependencies
5. Next steps

## Success Criteria
- All dev extensions documented
- Production-ready ones clearly marked with "x" tag
- Clear picture of what's blocking remaining extensions
- Priority list for next work
