Rework pi-question-tool to prevent models from ignoring earlier questions and focusing only on the final "would you like me to implement this?" question.

Current problem:
- Assistant message may have 5 bullet points with specific questions
- Model ignores all bullets and only responds to final question
- Results in incomplete/unhelpful answers

Required improvements:
1. Implement structured output format that models MUST follow
2. Improve prompt engineering to explicitly require answering ALL questions
3. Consider using step-by-step or numbered response requirements
4. Add enforcement/validation of complete responses
5. Possibly use RFC 2119 normative language (MUST, SHOULD, REQUIRED)

The extension MUST ensure that when presenting multiple questions to the user, the model MUST address each one comprehensively before proceeding to any follow-up question.
