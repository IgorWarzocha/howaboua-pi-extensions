Comprehensively audit ALL Pi extensions in repos to identify which ones to keep, consolidate, or remove.

## Full Extensions Inventory

### Source Repositories to Audit
- pi-extensions-repos/agent-stuff
- pi-extensions-repos/pi-subdir-context
- pi-extensions-repos/pi-powerbar
- pi-extensions-repos/pi-extmgr
- pi-extensions-repos/pi-extensions (the official ones)
- (Any other repos found in .pi/extensions or .pi/extensions-repos/)

### Audit Matrix for Each Extension
For every extension found, document:

| Extension | Used? | Want It? | Working? | Overlap? | Action |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| [name] | Daily/Yes/No | Yes/No/Maybe | Yes/No/Broken | Yes/No/Partial | Keep/Remove/Merge |

## Audit Categories

### 1. Actively Used Extensions
Extensions you use every day:
- [ ] List and verify they work correctly
- [ ] Check if they meet current needs
- [ ] Identify improvements needed
- [ ] Note any pain points or missing features

### 2. Want But Don't Have Extensions
Extensions you'd like to use but aren't set up:
- [ ] List them out
- [ ] Research why not installed yet
- [ ] Plan installation/development
- [ ] Note any blockers

### 3. Unused Extensions to Consider Removing
Extensions installed but never/rarely used:
- [ ] Identify which can be safely removed
- [ ] Check dependencies (other extensions might need them)
- [ ] Document removal plan

### 4. Extensions That Do Too Much
Extensions with overlapping functionality:
- [ ] Identify duplicates/redundancy
- [ ] Evaluate which implementation is better
- [ ] Consider consolidation opportunities
- [ ] Plan removal of redundant ones

### 5. Broken or Outdated Extensions
Extensions that don't work or are superseded:
- [ ] Test if they still fail
- [ ] Check if there's a maintained fork
- [ ] Document replacement options
- [ ] Mark for removal or replacement

## Overlap Analysis
### Potential Consolidation Opportunities
- [ ] **Multiple small extensions** → Could merge into one?
- [ ] **Similar functionality** → Pick best implementation?
- [ ] **Complementary features** → Bundle together?
- [ ] **Legacy implementations** → Modernize or replace?

## Output Artifacts
By end of audit, produce:
1. **Extensions to keep** - Working, wanted, no overlap
2. **Extensions to develop** - Wanted, not installed, or needs improvement
3. **Extensions to remove** - Unused, broken, or redundant
4. **Consolidation plan** - Which to merge and how
5. **Priority list** - What to work on first

## Success Criteria
- Complete inventory of all Pi extensions
- Clear classification for each extension (keep/dev/remove/merge)
- Action plan for removing unused/broken extensions
- Consolidation opportunities identified
- No "mystery" extensions remaining

## Execution Order
1. Inventory ALL extensions
2. Test categorization
3. Remove obvious junk first
4. Plan consolidation
5. Execute plan
