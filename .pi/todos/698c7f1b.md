Completed.

Final implemented scope:
- Hash-anchored mutation parser and executor.
- Spiral relocation (+/-100), tie fail-fast, drift handling.
- Per-call granular success/failure reporting.
- Overwrite protection for Add File (MUST use Update or Delete+Add replacement flow).
- Live sync anchors for successful writes.
- Targeted failure payloads (expected/actual/suggest) to reduce re-read needs.
- Blank-line tolerance between file sections.
- Trailing empty-line matching robustness.
- Delete diff suppression in UI and compact delete rendering.
- Sanitization guard to strip accidental leading LINEHASH prefixes from added content.
