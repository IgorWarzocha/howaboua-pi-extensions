Audit all pi-powerbar extension modules to understand functionality and determine which to use.

## Extensions Identified

The `pi-powerbar` repository contains multiple modules:
1. **powerbar-context** - Shows context window usage as progress bar with percentage
2. **powerbar-git** - Shows current git branch
3. **powerbar-model** - Shows current model name and thinking level
4. **powerbar-provider** - Shows LLM provider name
5. **powerbar-sub** - Hourly subscription usage from pi-sub-core
6. **powerbar-tokens** - Shows cumulative token stats and session cost

## Analysis Required

### Phase 1: Understand Each Module
For each module, document:
- What data it displays
- What events it listens to
- What it emits to powerbar
- When it updates
- Any dependencies or special behavior

### Phase 2: Evaluate Current Setup
- [ ] Check which modules are currently active
- [ ] Verify they work correctly
- [ ] Identify any redundancy or conflicts
- [ ] Check if all needed modules are loaded

### Phase 3: Decision - Consolidate or Keep Separate?

**Consolidation option**: Create a new single extension that combines desired functionality
- Pros: Single extension to manage, consistent API
- Cons: More complex to maintain

**Keep separate option**: Use existing pi-powerbar as-is
- Pros: battle-tested, maintained separately
- Cons: Multiple extensions loaded, potential conflicts

### Phase 4: Recommendation
Based on analysis:
- Determine which modules are actually useful for your workflow
- Recommend consolidation if many small modules with simple overlap
- Or recommend using pi-powerbar as-is if it meets needs
- Or recommend creating a custom subset if only a few segments needed

### Phase 5: Implementation (if consolidation chosen)
If consolidating:
1. Identify which segments to keep
2. Create new extension with combined functionality
3. Implement segment management
4. Add configuration options
5. Test thoroughly

## Outcome
By end of this task, you SHOULD have:
- Clear understanding of what each powerbar module does
- Recommendation on whether to use pi-powerbar as-is or create a custom version
- OR a new consolidated extension if that's the best path
