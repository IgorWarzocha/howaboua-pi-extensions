Outstanding items after high-priority fixes are intentionally lower impact and mainly about polish and maintainability.

Group 1: Data mutation style
- One path currently updates todo content by mutating the loaded record and then writing it back.
- This is working today and does not block correctness, but immutable update style is generally easier to reason about and less error-prone during future refactors.
- Decision needed: keep current straightforward mutation, or refactor now for consistency with immutable patterns.

Group 2: Directory label wording
- The extension currently displays a resolved directory path label.
- This is technically correct, but there is a UX question whether the label should instead echo the exact path string the user configured.
- Decision needed: prioritize explicit real path visibility or preserve user-input representation.

Group 3: Style-only control-flow cleanup
- One quick-action branch uses an else-if shape that differs from the preferred early-return style.
- Behavior is correct; this is readability and convention alignment only.
- Decision needed: leave as-is to avoid churn, or apply style cleanup for consistency.

No urgent behavior regressions are known in this remaining set. These are safe to review as product/style decisions.
