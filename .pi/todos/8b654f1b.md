Evaluate whether a custom system prompt is needed for Pi extension development work.

## Investigation Required

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review current AGENTS.md and any project-specific prompts
- [ ] Check if existing prompts adequately cover extension development
- [ ] Identify gaps or areas where prompts fall short
- [ ] Evaluate if tools are "getting out of hand" as mentioned

### Custom Prompt Considerations
If a custom prompt IS needed, it SHOULD address:
- Extension development workflows
- Tool usage patterns and best practices
- Pi extension API conventions
- Testing and debugging approaches
- Hot-reload workflows
- RFC 2119 normative language usage

### Implementation Path
If custom prompt IS needed:
- [ ] Create project-level AGENTS.md or similar
- [ ] Define clear coding standards for extensions
- [ ] Add extension-specific guidelines
- [ ] Include examples of good vs. bad patterns
- [ ] Document tool usage expectations

If custom prompt is NOT needed:
- [ ] Document why existing prompts are sufficient
- [ ] Update any project docs to reflect decision
- [ ] Note any minor adjustments to existing prompts if needed

## Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of whether custom prompt is needed
- If yes, well-defined custom prompt created
- If no, justification documented
- Prompt (if created) is tested and working
