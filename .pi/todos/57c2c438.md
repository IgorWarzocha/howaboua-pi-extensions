Figure out if GUIs can be standardized - same widths, consistent patterns, and create style guide/skill for extensions.

## Current State Assessment

### GUI Extensions to Review
Identify all extensions with TUI components:
1. **pi-todos** - Todo selector, action menu, detail overlay, detail modal
2. **pi-question-tool** - Question answering interface
3. **pi-worktree-forker** - Worktree creation confirmation
4. **pi-powerbar** - Powerline bar with multiple segments
5. **Any others with TUI components**

### Current Patterns Analysis
For each extension, document:
- [ ] Width/size conventions
- [ ] Color/theme usage patterns
- [ ] Input field styling
- [ ] Border/separator styles
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut patterns
- [ ] Icon/symbol usage
- [ ] Text alignment and spacing

## Standardization Strategy

### 1. Common Width Standards
- [ ] Define standard widths for different widget types
  - Selector/modal: 40-60 chars?
  - Input fields: 20-40 chars?
  - Status bars: variable?
  - Notifications: fixed width?
- [ ] Use responsive widths based on terminal size

### 2. Shared Component Library
- [ ] Identify reusable UI components
  - Buttons, selects, inputs, lists, etc.
- [ ] Extract to shared module or code snippet library
- [ ] Document component API
- [ ] Example usage for each component

### 3. Style Guide for Pi Extensions
Create comprehensive guide:
- [ ] Color palette usage (accent, muted, dim, error, success, warning)
- [ ] Border styles (single, double, rounded corners)
- [ ] Text formatting (bold, italic, alignment)
- [ ] Icon/symbol conventions
- [ ] Spacing and padding rules
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut notation

### 4. Skill for Extension Development
Create skill that auto-loads for extension devs:
- [ ] Loads UI style guide patterns
- [ ] Provides code snippets for common components
- [ ] Enforces RFC 2119 normative language in prompts
- [ ] Examples of good vs. bad TUI patterns
- [ ] Testing guidance for GUI extensions

### 5. Migration Plan
For existing extensions:
- [ ] Prioritize by usage frequency
- [ ] Update high-usage extensions first
- [ ] Document migration path for low-usage ones
- [ ] Consider deprecation for non-compliant extensions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery
- [ ] List all TUI-using extensions
- [ ] Document current patterns for each
- [ ] Identify inconsistencies

### Phase 2: Standards Definition
- [ ] Define width standards
- [ ] Define color/theme usage
- [ ] Define common component patterns
- [ ] Write style guide documentation

### Phase 3: Tools Creation
- [ ] Extract shared components
- [ ] Create component code snippets
- [ ] Build component examples
- [ ] Test components in isolation

### Phase 4: Skill Development
- [ ] Create extension-dev skill file
- [ ] Auto-load patterns and snippets
- [ ] Add prompts with RFC 2119 language
- [ ] Test skill loading

### Phase 5: Rollout
- [ ] Update critical extensions first
- [ ] Update remaining extensions
- [ ] Document deprecations
- [ ] Archive old patterns

## Success Criteria
- Clear style guide for Pi extension GUIs
- Shared component library available
- Extension-dev skill that enforces consistency
- Migration plan for existing extensions
- All future extensions follow standards
