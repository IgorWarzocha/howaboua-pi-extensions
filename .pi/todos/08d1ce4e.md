Figure out overlap between dev extensions and identify consolidation or split opportunities.

## Overlap Analysis Matrix

### Extensions with Similar Functionality

#### 1. Planning/Task Management
- **pi-todos** - Todo management with TUI, checklists (planned)
- **OpenCode Planning Toolkit** - Specs and plans for OpenCode (referenced for porting)
- **Potential overlap**: Both manage structured tasks/specs

#### 2. Context/File Management
- **pi-subdir-context** - Nested agents.md with context info (source for pi-nested-agents-md)
- **pi-nested-agents-md** (planned) - User-only info display + nested agents.md creation
- **pi-subdir-context** being used as source → high overlap potential

#### 3. Git/Workflow Management
- **pi-worktree-forker** - Auto git worktree on fork
- Any other git-related extensions?
- Potential for workflow consolidation

#### 4. Status/Information Display
- **pi-powerbar** modules:
  - Context usage, git branch, model info, tokens, provider, subscription usage
- Any other status bar extensions?
- **Potential overlap**: Multiple status segments could be unified

### Consolidation Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Merge Complementary Features
Multiple small extensions that work better together:
- [ ] Identify features that naturally group
- [ ] Create unified extension with combined functionality
- [ ] Simplify dependency management
- [ ] Reduce extension count for easier management
- **Example**: Combine several pi-powerbar modules into one configurable extension

#### Scenario B: Keep Separate but Standardize
Extensions are distinct but can share patterns:
- [ ] Identify shared UI patterns
- [ ] Create shared components library
- [ ] Define common widths/layouts
- [ ] Ensure consistent behavior
- [ ] Maintain separate extensions but with unified design

#### Scenario C: Split Overloaded Extensions
Extension doing too much:
- [ ] Identify extensions with multiple unrelated responsibilities
- [ ] Split into focused, single-purpose extensions
- [ ] Easier to maintain and test
- [ ] Clear boundaries between concerns
- **Example**: Extension handling both todos AND git operations → split into two

## Decision Framework

For each overlap or overloaded extension:
1. **Does it work?** → No action if broken
2. **Is it used?** → Remove if unused
3. **Do features overlap?** → Consider merge
4. **Is it overloaded?** → Consider split
5. **What's the simplest path?** → Favor fewer extensions with clear purpose

## Output Recommendations

For each finding, produce:
- [ ] Which extensions to merge (with new name and implementation plan)
- [ ] Which extensions to split (into what components)
- [ ] Which extensions to standardize (what patterns to share)
- [ ] Which extensions to deprecate (better replacement exists)

## Success Criteria
- Clear map of all extension overlaps
- Consolidation plan where applicable
- Split plan where applicable
- Standardization plan where applicable
- No ambiguity on which extensions should exist
