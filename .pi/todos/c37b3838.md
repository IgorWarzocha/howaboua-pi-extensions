## Completed

Tool description simplified in `index.ts`.

### Changes Made

**Before:** Long verbose description with:
- Detailed structure explanations
- "CRITICAL" warnings about context/removal conflicts
- Step-by-step instructions for replacing lines
- Many format details

**After:** Concise description:
- Simple structure: `'*** Begin Patch' → file sections → '*** End Patch'`
- Clear file section types: Add/Update/Delete
- Move/rename instruction simplified
- Essential format: `' 1:ab|x' = context, '-1:ab|x' = remove, '+x' = add`
- Key instruction: "Copy anchors EXACTLY from read output"

### Removed (handled by auto-corrections)
- Warning about context vs removal conflicts (auto-detected)
- Detailed line replacement instructions (self-healing handles this)
- Verbose format explanations (simplified)

### Acceptance Criteria Met

- [x] Description shorter and clearer
- [x] No warnings for auto-corrected issues
- [x] Still explains logical errors
