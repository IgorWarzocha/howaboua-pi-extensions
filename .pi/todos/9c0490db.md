Create a fancy Pi theme for extension development work - inspired by Claude aesthetics.

## Theme Design Requirements

### Visual Style
The theme SHOULD have a "fancy" aesthetic:
- [ ] Modern, polished look (not plain/boring)
- [ ] Claude-inspired or similar high-quality aesthetic
- [ ] Distinctive but readable
- [ ] Good contrast ratios for various backgrounds
- [ ] Professional but with personality

### Color Scheme Design
Define color palette:
- [ ] Primary/accent color (main actions, highlights)
- [ ] Secondary colors (different UI elements)
- [ ] Background colors (support for light/dark mode)
- [ ] Muted/dimmed colors for less important content
- [ ] Status colors (success, warning, error, info)
- [ ] Semantic colors that convey meaning at a glance

### Typography
- [ ] Clear, readable font selection
- [ ] Proper font weights for hierarchy
- [ ] Good line spacing and readability
- [ ] Code blocks stand out from prose
- [ ] Headers and body text have good contrast

### UI Element Styling

#### Borders and Separators
- [ ] Border style (solid, dashed, rounded corners?)
- [ ] Subtle dividers vs. stark borders
- [ ] Accent borders for important elements
- [ ] Muted borders for containers

#### Interactive Elements
- [ ] Button styles (primary, secondary, ghost)
- [ ] Input field styling (focus states, placeholders)
- [ ] Select/choice highlighting
- [ ] Scrollbar styling (subtle but visible)
- [ ] Hover/active states

#### Status Indicators
- [ ] Success states (greenish, checkmarks, ✓ symbols)
- [ ] Error states (reddish, × symbols, alerts)
- [ ] Warning states (yellowish, ! symbols, notices)
- [ ] Progress indicators (bars, spinners, percentages)

### Special Effects
- [ ] Any subtle gradients (use sparingly)
- [ ] Box shadows or depth effects
- [ ] Animation hints (if supported by pi-tui)
- [ ] Icon/emoji integration
- [ ] Visual hierarchy through color, size, and positioning

## Implementation

### Theme File Structure
- [ ] Create theme directory: `.pi/themes/[theme-name]/`
- [ ] Create theme definition file (JSON or TS)
- [ ] Export theme function matching Pi theme API
- [ ] Add README with color samples and usage
- [ ] Add screenshots if possible

### Testing
- [ ] Test in light mode
- [ ] Test in dark mode
- [ ] Test with various terminal colors
- [ ] Test code blocks, lists, tables
- [ ] Test interactive elements (inputs, buttons)

### Integration
- [ ] Add to .pi/themes/ symlink
- [ ] Update theme selection in Pi settings
- [ ] Document theme features and usage
- [ ] Ensure theme works with all extension GUIs

## Reference Inspiration
- [ ] Note the existing opencode theme that "looks like claude"
- [ ] Study its color choices and patterns
- [ ] Identify what makes it work well
- [ ] Either enhance existing or create new

## Success Criteria
- Complete theme with all color mappings
- Theme exports properly with Pi API
- Theme looks "fancy" and professional
- Works in both light and dark modes
- Well documented and tested

## Optional: Theme Variants
Consider creating:
- [ ] Multiple color schemes (e.g., blue, purple, green accent)
- [ ] Multiple intensities (minimal vs. rich)
- [ ] Preset themes for different workflows
