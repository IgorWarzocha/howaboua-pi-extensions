Implement standardized XML tag usage in documentation and prompts to improve model parsing and response reliability.

## Core Requirements

### 1. XML Tag Standardization
- [ ] Define a standard set of XML tags for different content types (e.g., `<objective>`, `<rules>`, `<procedure>`, `<example>`, `<feedback>`).
- [ ] All documentation (AGENTS.md, skill files, extension READMEs) SHOULD use these tags to wrap logical sections.
- [ ] Ensure tags are uniquely named and clear in their purpose.

### 2. Prompt Engineering Integration
- [ ] Incorporate XML-wrapped instructions into extension prompts.
- [ ] Use tags like `<context>`, `<task>`, and `<constraints>` when injecting instructions into the LLM flow.
- [ ] Combine XML structure with RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, etc.) for maximum "oomph".

### 3. Documentation Audit
- [ ] Review current `pi-extensions-dev` documentation for missing XML structure.
- [ ] Update `opencode-planning-toolkit` porting plan to include XML tag requirements.

## Success Criteria
- Models demonstrate improved adherence to instructions due to clearer structural boundaries.
- All new dev extensions follow the XML + RFC 2119 documentation pattern.
- GUI components use XML-wrapped metadata where applicable.
