Completed.

Implemented:
- Coordinated index.ts hooks (session_start, turn_start, tool_call, before_agent_start).
- Quick-fix style recovery payloads in apply failures (expected/actual/suggest anchored windows).
- Finalized and tightened system prompt/tool instructions for apply_patch protocol and anchored hunks.
- UX polish: success/partial/fail status messaging and result-tone coloring, delete diff suppression.
