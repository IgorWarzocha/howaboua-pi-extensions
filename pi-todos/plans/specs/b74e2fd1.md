## Objective

Specify GUI review queue behavior so users can verify completion quality before manually closing documents.

## Scope

- review-all from list view
- review-item from detail view
- sorting ready-for-review items above in-progress items

## Non-Goals

- closing items through review action
- hidden automatic lifecycle transitions

## Constraints

- review action MUST be user-triggered
- prompt payload MUST include linked required reading files

## Deliverables

- review queue interaction spec
- review prompt contract inputs and outputs

## Acceptance Criteria

- GUI can invoke review-all and review-item deterministically
- review action never mutates status directly

## Risks

- noisy review prompts may reduce signal
- incorrect sorting may bury urgent work

## Implementation Notes

Use derived progress labels from checklist booleans and keep lifecycle status user-owned.
Treat this file as a template blueprint for generated spec files.

## Verification Plan

Simulate list states and confirm action outputs, prompt payload fields, and sorting behavior.
