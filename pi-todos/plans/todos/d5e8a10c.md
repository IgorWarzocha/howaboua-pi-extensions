## Objective

Implement GUI review queue actions that allow user-triggered model verification without automatic closure.

## Scope

- list-level review-all action
- detail-level review-item action
- safe prompt dispatch with linked context

## Non-Goals

- autonomous closure logic
- CLI exposure to model

## Constraints

- action outputs must be deterministic
- status field must remain user-controlled

## Deliverables

- implemented review queue actions
- prompt templates for review workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

- both review actions exist and dispatch prompts correctly
- lifecycle status does not change from review action

## Risks

- action routing complexity in existing UI flow
- regressions in selector interactions

## Implementation Notes

Reuse current prompt building patterns where possible and keep new UI branches minimal.
Treat this file as a template blueprint for generated todo files.

## Verification Plan

Manually test main list and detail view review actions and inspect emitted prompt payloads.
