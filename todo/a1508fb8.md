Investigate current LSP hook reliability and create custom version using biome + oxlint.

## Investigation Phase

### 1. Verify Current LSP Hook Status
- Check if LSP hook is working reliably
- Identify issues or failures
- Understand what current LSP hook does
- Document any bugs or unreliability

### 2. Explore Alternative LSP Tools
- **biome** - Fast linter/formatter
- **oxlint** - Additional linting tool
- Understand tool capabilities
- Compare with current LSP setup
- Evaluate reliability/performance

## Implementation Phase

### 3. Create Custom LSP Hook Extension
- Fork or create new extension from scratch
- Name suggestion: `pi-biome-lsp` or `pi-lsp-reliable`
- Integrate biome for linting/formatting
- Integrate oxlint for additional checks
- Ensure proper error handling

### 4. Hook Integration
- Register LSP-related hooks properly
- Handle diagnostics correctly
- Provide clear error messages
- Support hot-reload if applicable
- Should be more reliable than current implementation

### 5. Configuration
- Allow configuration for biome + oxlint
- Support project-specific settings
- Maybe add `.pi/config.json` options for tool paths
- Document setup requirements

### 6. Testing
- Test with various file types (TS, JS, etc.)
- Verify diagnostics are reported correctly
- Test with hot-reload workflow
- Compare reliability with original LSP hook

## Success Criteria
- LSP hook works reliably without crashes
- biome and oxlint both integrated
- Clear error handling and recovery
- Better/more reliable than current implementation

## Reference Points
- Find current LSP hook implementation location
- Check biome and oxlint documentation
- May need to look at pi documentation for LSP hook API
