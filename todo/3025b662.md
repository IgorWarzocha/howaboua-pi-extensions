- Investigate collision rates for case-insensitive vs case-sensitive hashing.
- Port Unicode normalization and implement 'Hyper-Robust' filtering (NFC, control chars).
- Implement high-performance FNV-1a hashing with Base26 output.
- Discovered 'Natural Token Splitting' hack: No separator between LINE and HASH saves ~10% tokens.
- Project structured into modular `src/shared`, `src/read`, and `src/apply` folders.
- Verified with `tiktoken` test engine.
