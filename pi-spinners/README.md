 # pi-spinners
 
 Whimsical thinking messages for Pi.
 
 This extension is based on and expanded from the original whimsical extension by [Armin Ronacher](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/tree/main/pi-extensions). We thank him for the inspiration and the starting point for these messages.
 
 ## Behavior
 - Triggers on \`turn_start\` and \`tool_call\` to set a random whimsical message.
 - Resets the working message on \`turn_end\`.
 - Contains several categories of quotes: tech, scifi, fantasy, nonsense, and more.
